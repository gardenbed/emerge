# Emerge

Emerge is a command-line tool for automatically generating
[lexers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) and [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing)
in [Go](https://go.dev) from an [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_form)
description of any arbitrary grammar (language).

For an in-depth description of the project, please see the full documentation [here](./docs/index.md).

## Quick Start

### Install

```
brew install gardenbed/brew/emerge
```

For other platforms, you can download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/gardenbed/emerge/releases/latest).

### Examples

Below is the context-free grammar for the JSON language in EBNF format. Save this as `json.grammar`:

```
grammar json

NUMBER = /-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?/
STRING = /"([\x21\x23-\x5B\x5D-\x7E]\|\\[\x21-\x7E])+"/

start    = value;
value    = object | array | STRING | NUMBER | "true" | "false" | "null";
object   = "{" members "}" | "{" "}";
members  = members "," member | member;
member   = STRING ":" value;
array    = "[" elements "]" | "[" "]";
elements = elements "," value | value;
```

```bash
emerge json.grammar
```
